# RSA Encryption - Discrete Mathematics Final Project

This is the final project for the Discrete Mathematics course with Simon Izasa. The project focuses on implementing RSA encryption, a widely used cryptographic algorithm, in Python.

## Project Files

The project consists of three Python files:

1. [RSAKeyGeneration.py](https://github.com/Shadowjumper3000/RSA-Encryption/edit/main/README.md): This file is responsible for generating a public and private key pair using two given prime numbers. The public key can be used for encryption, while the private key is used for decryption.

2. [RSAEncryption.py](https://github.com/Shadowjumper3000/RSA-Encryption/edit/main/README.md): This file implements the encryption process using a given public key. It can encrypt any given message, including capital letters, whitespaces, and numbers.

3. [RSADecryption.py](https://github.com/Shadowjumper3000/RSA-Encryption/edit/main/README.md): This file handles the decryption process using the corresponding private key. It can decrypt any encrypted message.

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Run the [RSAKeyGeneration.py](https://github.com/Shadowjumper3000/RSA-Encryption/edit/main/README.md) file to generate a public and private key pair.

2. Use the generated public key to encrypt a message by running the [RSAEncryption.py](https://github.com/Shadowjumper3000/RSA-Encryption/edit/main/README.md) file.

3. To decrypt the encrypted message, use the corresponding private key by running the [RSADecryption.py](https://github.com/Shadowjumper3000/RSA-Encryption/edit/main/README.md)file.

Please note that the project assumes basic knowledge of Python programming and the RSA encryption algorithm.
