# RSA-Encryption
S1 Discrete Mathmatics Final Project

This is a Final Project for Discrete Math-1 with Simon Izasa.
RSA-KeyGeneration is responsible for creating a public and private key using 2 given prime numbers.

RSA-Encryption will using a public key, encrypt any given message. It will differentiate between capitals, including whitespaces and numbers.

RSA-Decryption will given the corresponding Private key, decrypt any message as encrypten.
